===========

This is a project that I started about 6-7 months ago. I worked on it for a bit and put it down.
The intention of this was to turn into an Ansible Tower alternative with a ton of options. Allowing
for back-end components to be pluggable. Jenkins integration, ELKStack, PowerDNS, PHPipam, VMWare,
OpenStack and so much more. I initially built this around a simple SQLite DB but planned on porting
to MySQL. I wrote all of the PHP code for the pages and etc. So yeah...a lot of work needed there.


So I have decided to put this out here in hopes that maybe someone may have a need for something
like this and/or contribute to this and push it along as an open-source project. Then again
it may not be of any use but in any case. I am putting it out here. Feel free to contribute as you
see fit.

Enjoy!
